# 0x00 Intro
---
This project is made for myself and for readers as well to learn "Grey Hat C" based on projects that I've created from many sources for personal use.

> **Disclaimer**: This personal portfolio contains heavily reproduced projects/scripts from the books that I will mention later, although there will be some 'homemade' and 'customized' scripts or sections, especially from the other online sources, or youse could use it in further sections to learn exploit and malware scripting, which will be useful later for future usages (i.e. kernel-based CVE hunting, commercial exams (i.e. OSED, CAPE, CRTP, etc.), stealth malware development, and many more).

# 0x10 Background
---
There are so many guides to learn C, especially for beginners who want to learn C as the first programming language. I started way back with C and C++ for a long time ago, since I was in my first college. Back then, I only code for the college tasks until I never code after I graduated, leading to rusty brain. This year, I revisited to learn code with Codecademy, especially for starting to code with C. Now, I'm currently learn scripting based on the reference of "Hacking - The Art Of Exploitation", by Jon Erickson. Although this book is released 17 years ago, there are some materials that might be useful to learn C in the way of "Grey Hats" do, including basic exploits, networking, and/or even shellcodes.

# 0x30 Sources and References

I would like to give shout outs to some materials that found to learn scripting with C, especially Codecademy (definitely not sponsored) that taught me start coding again, along with their easy and guided projects. I recommend books and PDFs that inspires me for this project, which are:
- Erickson, Jon. 2008. Hacking - The Art Of Exploitation
- Parlante, Nick. 1996-2003. Essential C (If you'd like to read basics of C, including syntaxes, variables, functions, and more)

Finally, I would like to thank the Twitter Community "[C and Assembly Developers](https://x.com/i/communities/1783990533192651232){:target="_blank"} that helped me to obtain sources and projects that I can learn with C. And lastly, shout out to these accounts that provide guides, tricks, and projects that also inspires me to code again.
